This year we are running for FaRaFIN with a seperate list. We chose to do so, because with the years the work in this council has become more and more stuck and we don’t believe that it is possible to fix this system from inside (some of us having tried and failed at this in the past).

Traditionally the election for this council has been more or less meaningless, because only one list was present. Thus, the main relevant point of the elections, was who would be able to run for speaker of finances - but even if the chosen person didn’t make the “first seven”, enough people stepped down until that person was amongst those.

With the election being meaningless, there was never any ambition to do a meaningful election campaign - campaigning for oneself was also one thing frowned upon by the “one list”. Thus most students were never really enabled to know who stands for what and who they should vote for.

In running with a second list we force a change in this. We have written a program with points we as a list have committed ourselves to work for. Furthermore our members all have written their own motiviation, which you can check on our website.
